Selenium automation framework using Java and TestNG – built for LambdaTest TestNG certification.


This project was created and submitted as part of the **LambdaTest Selenium Java 101 Certification**.  
It demonstrates my ability to build a functional UI automation test suite using **Selenium WebDriver**, **Java**, and **TestNG**.

---

## ✅ Key Highlights

- Built using the **TestNG testing framework**
- Designed following **modular and maintainable test structure**
- Includes a **BaseClass** for WebDriver setup and teardown
- Covers multiple **real-world UI automation scenarios**
- Generates **HTML TestNG reports** on execution

## 🚀 Selenium Grid Configuration on LambdaTest

As part of the testing setup, I configured a **Selenium Grid** on the **LambdaTest** cloud platform, enabling seamless execution of tests across multiple environments.

### 🛠️ Key Highlights:
- **Remote Test Execution:** Executed tests directly from my local setup, leveraging LambdaTest's cloud infrastructure.
- **Parallel Testing:** Ran tests in parallel across various browsers and operating systems, ensuring faster feedback and broader test coverage.
- **Scalability:** Utilized the power of cloud infrastructure for efficient and scalable **cross-browser testing**.

This setup ensures maximum test efficiency and reliability in a cloud-based testing environment, providing flexibility to scale as needed.

By using LambdaTest's infrastructure, I was able to significantly reduce test execution time while ensuring that the tests were performed in real browser environments across different platforms.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- UI automation using Selenium WebDriver
